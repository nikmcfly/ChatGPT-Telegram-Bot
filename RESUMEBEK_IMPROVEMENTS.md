# Resumebek Bot - Production Improvements

This document outlines all the production-ready improvements made to address the issues identified in `issues.md`.

## 1. Docker Build Process ✅

### Issue
The original Docker build process was fetching code from the upstream repository, not including Resumebek customizations.

### Solution
Created new Docker configuration files:
- `Dockerfile.resumebek` - Builds from local code with all customizations
- `docker-compose.resumebek.yml` - Production-ready compose configuration

### Usage
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker-compose -f docker-compose.resumebek.yml build

# Run the container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.resumebek.yml up -d
```

## 2. Improved Resume & Language Detection ✅

### Issue
Basic keyword-based detection was prone to false positives/negatives.

### Solution
Created `resume_detector_improved.py` with:
- **Confidence scoring system** - Returns confidence percentages
- **Expanded keyword lists** - More comprehensive detection
- **Pattern matching** - Detects phone numbers, emails, dates, bullet points
- **Structure analysis** - Checks document structure and length
- **Character-based fallback** - Uses Cyrillic vs Latin ratio when keywords fail
- **Contact extraction** - Extracts email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub

### Features
- Resume detection threshold configurable (default 40%)
- Language detection with confidence scores
- Contact information extraction

## 3. Follow-up Message Persistence ✅

### Issue
Using `asyncio.sleep()` lost all scheduled follow-ups on bot restart.

### Solution
Created `follow_up_persistent.py` with:
- **JobQueue integration** - Uses telegram bot's JobQueue
- **File-based persistence** - Stores jobs in `followup_jobs.json`
- **Automatic restoration** - Restores jobs on bot restart
- **Overdue handling** - Sends immediately if scheduled time passed

### Features
- Survives bot restarts
- Handles overdue messages
- Logs all follow-up events

## 4. Analytics with File Locking ✅

### Issue
Concurrent writes could corrupt analytics file, single file grew too large.

### Solution
Created `analytics_improved.py` with:
- **Async locking** - Prevents concurrent write corruption
- **Daily file rotation** - One file per day
- **Automatic cleanup** - Removes files older than 30 days
- **Enhanced statistics** - Conversion rates, hourly distribution
- **Export functionality** - JSON and CSV export support

### Features
- Thread-safe file operations
- Daily statistics with trends
- Weekly statistics aggregation
- Export for external analysis

## 5. Comprehensive Error Handling ✅

### Issue
Limited error handling led to poor user experience and silent failures.

### Solution
Created `resume_handler_improved.py` with:
- **Multi-language error messages** - Localized for KK/RU/EN
- **Specific error types** - File read, network, timeout, API, size errors
- **Retry logic** - 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Graceful degradation** - Continues even if follow-up scheduling fails
- **Timeout protection** - 30s for file extraction, 60s for analysis

### Error Types Handled
- File too large (>10MB)
- File read failures
- Network errors
- API timeouts
- LLM API errors
- Telegram API errors

## 6. Additional Improvements

### Monitoring & Observability
- Comprehensive logging with log levels
- Analytics tracking for all events
- Error tracking with context

### Performance Optimizations
- File size limits
- Text length limits for API calls
- Timeout configurations
- Async operations throughout

### Security Considerations
- No sensitive data in logs
- File access controls
- Input validation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Resumebek specific
BOT_MODE=resumebek
RESUME_ANALYSIS_MODE=True
AI_PHOTOS_URL=https://aiphotos.kz/student-pack

# Standard bot configuration
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
API=your_openai_api_key
CUSTOM_MODELS=gpt-4o,gpt-4o-mini
PASS_HISTORY=3
```

### File Structure
```
/app/
├── analytics/           # Daily analytics files
├── user_configs/        # User configuration files
├── followup_jobs.json   # Persistent follow-up jobs
└── [bot files]
```
